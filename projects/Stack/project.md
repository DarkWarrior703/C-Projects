# Stack

**Create a stack class where the user can push a value, pop it and return the top. It also should return if it is Empty.**

*Hint: The class can represent an array, the capacity and the current count.*
*I linked 2 source codes, first representing a beginner version of Stack, the second being a more advanced. The first uses an array of int and uses (new) operator. The second uses templates and function overloading.*
