# Staff Managment

**Build a console app where the user can insert a entry, display all entries, display all entries with a wage higher than 20k, search, edit and delete via id. Entries should be saved in a file**
*An entry is made out of employee id, name, address, role and salary.*


*Hint: store all these informations in a class for easy reading and use binary mode in file opening.*

I wrote a single file containing the code to keep it simple. 

Credit goes to [1000 Projects](https://1000projects.org/staff-management-system-c.html). I changed the statement a bit.
